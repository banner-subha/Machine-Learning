# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts car selling prices based on various factors such as age, fuel type, transmission, driven kilometers, and ownership status. It utilizes machine learning models, data visualization (Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib), and feature engineering to generate insights.

## 💍 Features

✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Plotly & Seaborn
✔️ Feature Engineering (Label Encoding, Standardization)
✔️ Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Regressor)
✔️ Performance Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
✔️ Interactive Visualizations using Plotly Graph Objects

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
Seaborn & Matplotlib (Statistical Visualizations)
Plotly (Interactive Graphs & Subplots)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Model)
