This project analyzes unemployment trends across different regions in India, focusing on the impact of COVID-19. The dataset includes monthly unemployment rates, estimated employment, and labor participation rates from May 2019 to November 2020. Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, we perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights.
